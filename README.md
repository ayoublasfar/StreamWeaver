# StreamWeaver 🌐

**A Unified Real-Time Data Fabric for Intelligent Stream Integration, Schema Evolution, and Distributed Analytics**

StreamWeaver is a research and production-grade platform designed to address the challenges of heterogeneous data stream integration in distributed systems. The project implements intelligent schema normalization, drift detection, and real-time analytics capabilities to create a consistent, queryable data layer across diverse streaming sources.

---

## 📋 Overview

In distributed environments, data originates from multiple sources—APIs, IoT sensors, application logs, transaction systems, and user events. Each source typically employs different schemas, transmission frequencies, and data formats (JSON, Avro, CSV, Protobuf), creating significant integration complexity.

StreamWeaver addresses this challenge by constructing a real-time data fabric that:

- Ingests heterogeneous data streams through distributed message queues
- Normalizes structures and metadata dynamically across sources
- Detects and adapts to schema drift and field evolution automatically
- Propagates unified data to analytics systems and downstream services in real-time

The platform functions as an intelligent integration layer that transforms disparate data streams into a consistent, queryable real-time data infrastructure.
